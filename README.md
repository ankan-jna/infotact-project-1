Myntra Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard
 Sales Performance Overview
 Our business recorded 3.5K total orders across 40 products, generating a total sales amount of 1.88M and
 revenue of 3M, with an average discount of 35.51%. This tells us the business leans heavily on discounting
 as a revenue driver.
 Time-Based Sales Trends
 1. Monthly Discount vs Sales
 Insight: Despite fluctuations in discounts, overall sales remained relatively consistent with a small peak in
 January and May.
 Narrative: Strategic discounting in early and mid-year months likely helped maintain steady sales, but too
 frequent discounts may be eroding margins without proportionate volume increases.
 2. Day-Wise Sales Distribution
 Insight: Thursday and Friday saw the highest sales volume.
 Narrative: This suggests customers tend to shop toward the end of the work week, possibly in anticipation of
 the weekend. Promotions timed for Thursdays and Fridays could enhance conversion.
 Brand and Product Analysis
 1. Top Performing Brands
 Puma leads in total revenue (~0.4M), followed by H&M and Roadster.
 Narrative: Focused brand collaborations and exclusive launches with Puma could yield even better ROI.
 2. Product Category Split
 Womens products contribute the most (32.33%), followed closely by Mens and Beauty (32.2%, 20.19%).
 Narrative: Targeting women customers with curated promotions and expanding the beauty segment could be
 fruitful.
 3. Most Sold Products
 Jeans and Shorts are top performers, suggesting a preference for casual wear.
 Narrative: Increase inventory and offer bundled deals on popular items like jeans + tops to drive
 cross-category sales.

 Geographic Sales Insights
 Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the top contributors.
 Narrative: These states are high-potential markets. Consider localized campaigns or partnerships with
 regional influencers to drive even deeper engagement.
 Category Trends Over Quarters
 The product category trend remains consistent across quarters.
 Narrative: While consistent performance is good, it's also a sign of saturation. New category introductions or
 seasonal product lines could spur growth.
 Summary Table Insight
 H&M had the most orders but not the highest revenue per order.
 Adidas, despite fewer orders, yielded higher revenue due to high value per sale.
 Narrative: Tailored strategies per brandvolume-driven for H&M and premium-experience for Adidaswill help
 maximize brand value.
